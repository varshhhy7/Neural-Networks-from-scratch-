    "---\r\n",
    "This code performs a forward pass for a batch of three input samples through a dense layer with three neurons, using NumPy’s matrix multiplication to compute the dot product between each input vector and the transposed weight matrix, then adding the bias vector element-wise — producing a 3×3 output matrix where each row corresponds to the linear outputs of all neurons for one input sample, enabling efficient parallel evaluation across multiple data points. The np.array() conversion ensures that weights is explicitly treated as a NumPy array, guaranteeing proper matrix operations even if weights were initially defined as a nested Python list — this avoids potential ambiguity in broadcasting or alignment during np.dot, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior across different input types."
