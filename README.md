# Mastering Neural Networks — From Scratch

> Documenting a hands-on journey to understand and implement neural networks step by step.

------------------------------------------------------------

$ about
A personal deep dive into the theory and implementation of neural networks — starting from first principles and building up to advanced architectures.

------------------------------------------------------------

$ contents
| Topic | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| MLP | Build and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron from scratch |
| CNN | Implement Convolutional Neural Networks and explore feature extraction |
| RNN / LSTM / GRU | Understand sequence modeling and recurrent architectures |
| Transformers | Learn and code the Attention mechanism and Transformer models |
| Theory | Notes on math, optimization, and core concepts |
| Experiments | Tests, visualizations, and performance analysis |

------------------------------------------------------------

$ approach
A code-first, concept-driven learning process focused on understanding *how* and *why* neural networks work — not just using them.

------------------------------------------------------------

$ status
Work in progress. Updated as learning progresses.
